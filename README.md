This project aims to assist the management team of a medical insurance company and insurance brokers by providing informative visualizations through Power BI. By exploring regional variations in total medical insurance costs and identifying cost disparities across different age groups, BMI categories, gender, and smoking status, the dashboard offers a comprehensive view of healthcare expenses. The visualization outcomes empower decision-making processes within the medical insurance company, enabling better healthcare management and customer service. Moreover, for insurance brokers and agents, this dashboard is a valuable tool for promoting tailored services to clients and facilitating informed decisions regarding healthcare coverage.
